\arguments{
\item{vote}{A labeled party vote share vector.}

\item{order}{Method to order parties (Default is "alphabetical"; also takes "descending" and "ascending" as well as manual specification of party vector)}

\item{sample_confidence_bounds}{Logical T/F: add empirical dirichlet quantiles}

\item{sample_n}{The number of observations in the poll sample.}

\item{n_draw}{How many samples to draw from the dirichlet distribution.}

\item{show_quantiles}{Vector of quantiles/confidence boundaries to calculate.}

\item{round}{Round to k decimals after comma}

\item{xlab}{x-label string}

\item{ylab}{y-label string}

\item{title}{title string}

\item{subtitle}{subtitle string}

\item{caption}{caption string}

\item{theme_ipsum}{Pre-applies nice theme from the hrbrthemes-package.(Attention: possible font-issues when Roboto font is not installed on your computer.)}

\item{grid}{(Applies only if theme_ipsum == T) Add a grid (options: "none","Y")}
